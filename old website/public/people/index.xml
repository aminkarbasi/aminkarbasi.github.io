      <description>I am a student of mathematics and computer science broadly interested in optimization, machine learning, and theoretical computer science. My recent interests surround online optimization and I have been working on designing adaptive algorithms for various online learning problems. I also have a soft spot for physics – I think it’s an all-round really fun subject and also provides tons of intuition.
In Fall 2020, I will be starting my PhD in CS at Yale.</description>
