# Course ID: ENAS 496 and 502

A study of stochastic processes and estimation, including fundamentals of detection and estimation. Vector space representation of random variables, Bayesian and Neyman-Pearson hypothesis testing, Bayesian and nonrandom parameter estimation, minimum-variance unbiased estimators, and the Cramer-Rao bound. Stochastic processes. Linear prediction and Kalman filtering. Poison counting process and renewal processes, Markov chains, branching processes, birth-death processes, and semi-Markov processes. Applications from communications, networking, and stochastic control.
