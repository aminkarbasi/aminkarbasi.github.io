# Course ID: EENG 433

The study of fundamental techniques in discrete optimization and its numerous industry applications, including airline scheduling, telecommunication routing, recommender systems, and predicting financial markets. Topics include linear programs, dynamic programs, finite and infinite state scenarios, bandit optimization, and potentially submodular functions and relationships between discrete and continuous optimization methods through the lens of submodularity. Familiarity with discrete mathematics, algorithms, combinatorics, and calculus is assumed.
