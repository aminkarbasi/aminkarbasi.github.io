# Julia Robinson Mathematical Festival:

In the last two years, and with the help of Yale’s Pathway to Science, I have co-organized Julia Robinson Mathematical festival at Yale. It is a celebration of mathematics where high school students come together to work collaboratively in groups to solve fun math problems.
