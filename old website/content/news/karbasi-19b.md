The ARA program funds projects conducted primarily by PhD students or post docs, under the supervision of the faculty member awarded the funds. To encourage collaboration and the sharing of insights, each funded proposal team is assigned an appropriate Amazon research contact. We also invite ARA recipients to speak at Amazon offices worldwide about their work and to meet with our research groups face-to-face, and encourage ARA recipients to publish their research outcome and commit related code to open-source code repositories.
