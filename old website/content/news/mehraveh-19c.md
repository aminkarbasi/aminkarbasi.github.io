On April 25, 2019, Columbia University and the United Nations hosted the first Ivy-wide 3-Minute Thesis Competition to celebrate the diverse scholarly work that PhD students are doing across the Ivy League community.  Following opening remarks by Elliott Harris, UN Assistant Secretary-General and Chief Economist, fourteen PhD students from Brown University, Columbia University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Princeton University, the University of Pennsylvania and Yale gave presentations about their research in just 3 minutes.  The winners of this year's event are:

Winner: Mehraveh Salehi (Electrical Engineering, Yale University),   "Individualized and Task-Specific Functional Brain Mapping"
2nd Place: Hannah Shoenhard (Neuroscience, University of Pennsylvania), "Linking Genes to Brain in Sensation and Decision-Making"
Audience Choice: Bailey Brown (Sociology, Columbia University), "Kinder Panic: School Selection and Parental Uncertainty"
Winners were chosen by an esteemed panel of judges that included:

Salim Hasham: Partner, McKinsey
