Amin Karbasi won [AFOSR Young Investigator Research Award 2018](https://www.wpafb.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/1339310/afosr-awards-grants-to-43-scientists-and-engineers-through-its-young-investigat/)!

ARLINGTON, Virginia -- The Air Force Office of Scientific Research today announced it will award approximately $19.9 million in grants to 45 scientists and engineers from 38 research institutions and small businesses who submitted winning research proposals through the Air Force's Young Investigator Research Program (YIP). 

The YIP is open to scientists and engineers at research institutions across the United States who received Ph.D. or equivalent degrees in the last five years and who show exceptional ability and promise for conducting basic research. 

The objective of this program is to foster creative basic research in science and engineering, enhance early career development of outstanding young investigators, and increase opportunities for the young investigators to recognize the Air Force mission and the related challenges in science and engineering. 

This year, AFOSR received over 280 proposals in response to the AFOSR YIP broad agency announcement (BAA) solicitation, BAA-AFRL-2017-0002. These technical areas included: Aerospace Materials for Extreme Environments, Aerothermodynamics, Atomic and  Molecular Physics, Biophysics, Computational Cognition and Machine, Computational Mathematics, Data Driven Applications Systems, Dynamics and Control, Dynamics Materials and Interactions, Electromagnetics and Sensing, Surveillance and Navigation, Energy Conversion and Combustion Sciences, Flow Interactions and Control, GHz-THz Electronics, Human Performance and Biosystems,  Information Operations and Security, Laser and Optical Physics, Low Density Materials, Mechanics of Multifunctional Materials and Microsystems, Molecular Dynamics and Theoretical Chemistry,  Multi-Scale Structural Mechanics and Prognosis, Natural Materials and Systems, Optimization and Discrete Mathematics, Optoelectronics and Physics,  Organic Materials Chemistry,  Quantum Electronic Solids,  Quantum Information Science, Remote Sensing and  Imaging, Science of Information, Computation and Fusion, Space Power and Propulsion,  Software and Systems, Test and Evaluation, and Turbulence and Transition.  
 
AFOSR program officers select proposals based on the evaluation criteria listed in the BAA.
