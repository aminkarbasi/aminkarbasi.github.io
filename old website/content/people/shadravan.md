Mohammad was a Postdoctoral Associate in the Institute for Network Science. He earned his PhD from Columbia University under the supervision of Professor Clifford Stein and Shipra Agrawal. His research interests lie primarily in the area of submodulariy in machine learning, algorithms for massive dataset, and optimization for sequential decision making. He completed his Master’s degree in the department of Combinatorics and Optimization at the University of Waterloo. Before that, he obtained his B.Sc. in Computer Engineering and Mathematics from Sharif University of technology.
