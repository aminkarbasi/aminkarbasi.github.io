I’m Javid Dadashkarimi PhD candidate in computer science department at Yale University. I’m so grateful to work with Dustin Scheinost and Amin Karbasi in my PhD. Currently, I am interested in finding a mechanism to transfer human brain images between two atlases, with different resolutions, or with variable shapes: Check out [my website](http://dadashkarimi.github.io) for more information.
