Chris Harshaw is a 6th year PhD student in the Computer Science department where he is advised by Amin Karbasi and Dan Spielman. His research focuses on developing algorithmic techniques for causal inference, with the goal of enabling experimenters and analysts to be more confident in their findings. From an algorithmic perspective, he works on spectral algorithms, submodular optimization, and non-convex programming. More broadly, his interests lie in optimization, statistics, and their intersection. He is a native Texan and enjoys playing and listening to jazz music.
