I am a Postdoctoral Associate in the Institute for Network Science.
I obtained my Ph.D. degree in the School of Electrical Engineering at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), where I am advised by Jinwoo Shin. I recieved an M.S. in Electrical engineering and a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Mathematics (minored) from KAIST. My research interests focus on approximate algorithm design and analysis for large-scale machine learning and its applications. Here is my CV.
