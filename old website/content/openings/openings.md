# PhD students

The I.I.D. Systems Group at the Yale Institute of Network Science has an open position for a Ph.D. student. We are looking for exceptional applicants who have a strong background in areas such as machine learning, statistics, optimization, theoretical computer science and distributed systems. Many problems studied in our group have a strong interdisciplinary component. See our research page for an overview of the projects that we are working on.

If you are interested, this is what you have to do. Admissions to the PhD program are done by a committee and not by individual professors. Therefore, as a first step, please fill out the application forms (Link 1). At around the same time you submit the application form you can send us an email alerting us to the fact that you applied. Please specify your background, what topics you are interested in, and attach a CV. This can help when we are browsing the large list of applicants to give our input to the committee. Due to the large number of emails we receive, please do not expect an answer. The best applicants will be given a fellowship from the department for a year. During the first year you have to take some classes and perform 2 research projects which hopefully are the starting point for your PhD. Good luck with your application!
