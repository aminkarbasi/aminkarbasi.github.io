Welcome to the [I.I.D.](#) group, led by [Amin Karbasi](/people/amin-karbasi). The research in our group is at the intersection of learning theory[\[1](/research/trust.md/),[2\]](/research/online_learning.md/), optimization[\[3](/research/submodular_optimization.md/),[4\]](/research/non_convex.md/), and information processing[\[5](/research/computational_neuroscience_neurimaging.md/),[6\]](/research/interactive_decision_making.md). We develop data-driven algorithms, with strong theoretical guarantees, that can automatically acquire and reason about highly uncertain information. For more information, please visit our [research directions](/research).
