# Abstract

In this paper, we propose a novel framework that converts streaming algorithms for monotone submodular maximization into streaming algorithms for non-monotone submodular maximization. This reduction readily leads to the currently tightest deterministic approximation ratio for submodular maximization subject to a k-matchoid constraint. Moreover, we propose the first streaming algorithm for monotone submodular maximization subject to k-extendible and k-set system constraints. Together with our proposed reduction, we obtain O(klogk) and O(k2logk) approximation ratio for submodular maximization subject to the above constraints, respectively. We extensively evaluate the empirical performance of our algorithm against the existing work in a series of experiments including finding the maximum independent set in randomly generated graphs, maximizing linear functions over social networks, movie recommendation, Yelp location summarization, and Twitter data summarization.
