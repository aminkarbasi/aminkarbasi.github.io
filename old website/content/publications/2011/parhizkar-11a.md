## Abstract

We consider the position calibration problem in circular tomography devices, where sensors deviate from a perfect circle. We introduce a new method of calibration based on the time-of-fiight measurements between sensors when the enclosed medium is homogeneous. Bounds on the reconstruction errors are proven and results of simulations mimicking a scanning device are presented.
