# Abstract

In this work we consider the problem of sensor network localization when only the connectivity information is available. More specifically, we compare the performance of the centralized algorithm MDS-MAP with its distributed version HOP-TERRAIN. We show that both algorithms are able to localize sensors up to a bounded error decreasing at a rate inversely proportional to the radio range r.
