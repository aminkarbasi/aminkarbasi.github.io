                This tutorial will cover recent advancements in discrete optimization methods for large-scale machine learning. Traditionally, machine learning has been harnessing convex optimization to design fast algorithms with provable guarantees for a broad range of applications. In recent years, however, there has been a surge of interest in applications that involve discrete optimization. For discrete domains, the analog of convexity is considered to be submodularity, and the evolving theory of submodular optimization has been a catalyst for progress in extraordinarily varied application areas including active learning and experimental design, vision, sparse reconstruction, graph inference, video analysis, clustering, document summarization, object detection, information retrieval, network inference, interpreting neural network, and discrete adversarial attacks.
                <img src="images/submodular.png" alt="icml " class="right-image" id="text-image">
                As applications and techniques of submodular optimization mature, a fundamental gap between theory and application emerges. In the past decade, paradigms such as large-scale learning, distributed systems, and sequential decision making have enabled a quantum leap in the performance of learning methodologies. Incorporating these paradigms in discrete problems has led to fundamentally new frameworks for submodular optimization. The goal of this tutorial is to cover rigorous and scalable foundations for discrete optimization in complex, dynamic environments, addressing challenges of scalability and uncertainty, and facilitating distributed and sequential learning in broader discrete settings. More specifically, we will cover advancements in four areas:
                <h1>Submodular Optimization</h1>

                <h2>Submodular Optimization with Perfect Information</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Fast Greedy Methods:</strong> The first class of methods considers cases where the size and dimension of the data is large, but data can be fully accessible and stored in memory. Fast greedy algorithms have been proposed recently with almost optimal run-time efficiency in terms of the query complexity and dimension of data while maintaining optimal quality guarantees.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Streaming Algorithms:</strong> In cases where the data sets are too large to be stored in memory, streaming techniques are used to perform computation on the fly. These algorithms achieve desirable guarantees for machine learning tasks while using modest memory resources.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Distributed Optimization:</strong> Distributed computation frameworks like MapReduce, Hadoop, and Spark have advanced machine learning. New algorithms leverage distributed resources to address submodular optimization's inherently non-parallelizable nature.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Submodular Optimization with Imperfect Information</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>The Stochastic Oracle:</strong> This oracle provides a stochastic but unbiased estimate of the function value. Techniques are developed with minimal sample and computational complexity, addressing applications like data summarization, recommender systems, and influence maximization in social networks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Online/Bandit Oracle:</strong> This oracle is used when interacting with an unknown, evolving, or adversarially changing environment. The goal is to create no-regret mechanisms for maximizing cumulative objectives over time, applicable in online resource allocation, dynamic multi-robot coverage, and online recommender systems.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>A Non-Convex Bridge Between Discrete and Continuous Optimization</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Framework Overview:</strong> A recently developed framework bridges discrete and continuous optimization by using continuous extensions. It finds good solutions through noisy objective value estimates, addressing highly non-convex challenges.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Tools and Techniques:</strong> These methods exploit submodularity's special structure to avoid undesirable stationary points. Continuous submodular functions provide a rich framework for tackling non-convex problems while achieving near-optimal solutions.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Beyond Submodularity</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Generalizations:</strong> Extensions such as adaptive submodularity, weak submodularity, and two-stage submodularity provide approximation guarantees beyond traditional submodular settings. These generalizations apply to interactive settings, dictionary learning, and sparse recovery.
                    </li>
                </ul>

              Submodular functions model the intuitive notion of diminishing returns. Due to their far-reaching applications, they have been rediscovered in many fields such as information theory, operations research, statistical physics, economics, and machine learning. They also enjoy computational tractability as they can be minimized exactly or maximized approximately.

              The goal of this talk is simple. We see how a little bit of randomness, a little bit of greediness, and the right combination can lead to pretty good methods for offline, streaming, and distributed solutions. I do not assume any background on submodularity and try to explain all the required details during the talk.

              Adaptive stochastic optimization under partial observability is one of the fundamental challenges in artificial intelligence and machine learning with a wide range of applications, including active learning, optimal experimental design, interactive recommendations, viral marketing,  Wikipedia link prediction, and perception in robotics, to name a few. In such problems, one needs to adaptively make a sequence of decisions while taking into account the stochastic observations collected in previous rounds. For instance, in active learning, the goal is to learn a classifier by carefully requesting as few labels as possible from a set of unlabeled data points. Similarly, in experimental design, a practitioner may conduct a series of tests in order to reach a conclusion. Even though it is possible to determine all the selections ahead of time before any observations take place (e.g., select all the data points at once or conduct all the medical tests simultaneously), so-called a priori selection, it is more efficient to consider a fully adaptive procedure that exploits the information obtained from past selections in order to make a new selection.  In this talk, we introduce semi-adaptive policies, for a wide range of decision-making problems, that enjoy the power of fully sequential procedures while performing exponentially fewer adaptive rounds.

              Submodularity is a structural property over functions that has received significant attention in the mathematics community, owing to their natural and wide ranging applicability.

              In particular, numerous challenging problems in information theory, machine learning, and artificial intelligence rely on optimization techniques for which submodularity is key to solving them efficiently.
              We will start by defining submodularity and polymatroidality — we will survey a surprisingly diverse set of functions that are submodular and operations that preserve submodularity. Next we look at submodular functions that have been classically used as information measures and their novel applications in ML and AI including active/semi-supervised learning, structured sparsity, data summarization, and combinatorial independence and generalized entropy. Subsequently, we’ll define the submodular polytope, and its relationship to the various greedy algorithms and its exact and efficient solution to certain linear programs. We will see how submodularity shares certain properties with convexity (efficient minimization, discrete separation, subdifferentials, lattices and sub-lattices, and the convexity of the Lovasz extension), concavity (via its definition, submodularity via concave functions, superdifferentials), and neither (simultaneous suband super-differentials, efficient approximate maximization). Finally, we will discuss some extensions of submodularity that have proven useful in recent years.
